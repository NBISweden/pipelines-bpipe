HOW TO RUN A PIPELINE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pipelines are defined as a set of (possibly branching) connected
processing steps, recored in each pipleline definition (ending in
.bpipe).

The actual processing steps are included in the modules sub-directory of
the pipeline root folder.  It is therefore necessary to make sure that
the environment variable $BPIPE_LIB points to this folder.

In addition to the individual pipeline logics, you need to copy the two
template files bpipe.config.template and pipeline.config.template to the
folder you wish to execute the pipeline in (and rename them to remove
the .template suffix).

bpipe.config
    Includes information on the resource manager to use and the
    resources to be allocated to different steps of the pipeline.

pipeline.config
    Includes a list variables need for the execution of pipeline stages
    (including the location of binaries etc.)
